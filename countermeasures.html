            <li class="list-paragraph">
                <span class="sub-headings">Research the sources</span>
                Always be careful of any unsolicited messages. Check the domain links to see if they are real, and the person sending you the email if they are actual members of the organization. Utilize a search engine, go to the company's website, check their phone directory. These are all simple, easy way to avoid getting spoofed. Hovering your cursor on a link before you actually click on it will reveal the link at the bottom, and is another way to make sure you are being redirected to the correct company's website.

                <span class="sub-headings">Email Spoofing</span>
                As you know hacker needs to reach out if he wants to hack you.Thus email could be the best way to do that. He will take any trusted email that is spoofable and will sent mail through trusted person's name.So lets have a look how to check whether email is secured or not.

                        </span> 
                        Call sender if possible and verify whether he has sent any email and does it contain any file, link, or other attachment.

                        </span> 
                        Check for reciever authentication by hovering over his photo and if there is question mark then user might not be the legimiate sender.

            <li class="list-paragraph">
                <span class="sub-headings">Don't download until 100% sure</span>
                From the email you get an idea whether it could have any file to be downloaded. But still for security reason ask sender on phone whether he has sent any attachment, or tell sender before to write keyword like URGENT in subject if anything needs to be downloaded.
            </li>
            <li class="list-paragraph">
                <span class="sub-headings">
                    Don't believe in offers and prizes easily
                </span>
                Offers and prizes are used as baits to get you in trap.Hacker throws pendrive in coffee shop and getting it free you take it up and start using it directly to your computer and loses everything. Then online cheap offers make you spent money and in return you get nothing.Recent case of mobile phones have been seen over social media handles where they promise to give smartphone in 5000 which actual cost you 35000. Don't get fooled by them.

Don't share password even via call, doesn't matter how important it is.If someone in your company needs data urgent then visit your company  and check whole scenerio instead.
